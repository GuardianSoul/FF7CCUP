All are welcome to participate so long as any submitted artwork is your own. Do not source images from outside sources without license.

Contributors - check "/textures/priority/" directory. These textures need manual editing. However, if you feel inspired to work on a certain type of texture or certain character, by all means follow your inspiration!

Currently all textures have been upscaled using Topaz Gigapixel AI. I've considered using other, opensource AI upscalers such as ESRGAN, however Topaz' solution is much faster and this project ended up being a much bigger task than I initially envisioned. 

Installation:

This texture package is designed for the PPSSPP emulator using the US disc image for Final Fantasy 7: Crisis Core. For Windows, install the package into into \Users\[your user name]\Documents\PPSSPP\PSP\TEXTURES\ULUS10336\. You must then enable texture replacements in PPSSPP to load the textures. If you want to contribute to testing, please activate texture dumping in your emulator and add any missing textures to missing-textures branch under the "missed textures" directory. I've also developed some simple tools for sorting through the textures. I am currently looking to improve them to make them more user friendly - any help would be appreciated on that front.
