All are welcome to participate so long as any submitted artwork is your own. Do not source images from outside sources without license.

Contributors - check "/textures/priority/" directory. These textures need manual editing. However, if you feel inspired to work on a certain type of texture or certain character, by all means follow your inspiration!

Currently all textures have been upscaled using Topaz Gigapixel AI. I've considered using other, opensource AI upscalers such as ESRGAN, however Topaz' solution is much faster and this project ended up being a much bigger task than I initially envisioned.
